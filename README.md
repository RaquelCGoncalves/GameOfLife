# GameOfLife
 A simple console version of Game Of Life implemented in C++ and written in linux. 

Rules:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.

- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
